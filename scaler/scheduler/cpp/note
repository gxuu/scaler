we will support one thing when there are many things
we will support one type when there are many
we will make it fast rather than slow

next step:
 - figure out the main logic of say addrss monitor
 - is scheduler a singleton?
 - how to store *manager? 

 How many schedulers are there? 
 How many managers are there

here's the plan:
 - impl every member
 - impl every function decl
 - actual impl


1. Figure out how to compare workers
 - Define StateWorker won't work
 - Define as bytes or std::span<std::byte> won't work
 - Define as integer or other comparable types *probably* won't work
