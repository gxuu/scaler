    Stateless scaling policy that cascades worker scaling across prioritized adapters.

    Priority-1 adapters fill first; overflow goes to priority-2, then priority-3, etc.
    Shutdown is reversed: highest priority number (least preferred) drains first.

    Rules specify adapter ID prefixes (e.g. ``NAT``, ``ECS``). At runtime each adapter
    generates a full ID like ``NAT|<pid>``. Matching uses prefix: an adapter ID matches
    a rule when ``adapter_id == rule_prefix`` or ``adapter_id`` starts with
    ``rule_prefix + b"|"``.

    All configuration (rules, thresholds) is immutable after construction.
    All mutable state is passed as function parameters.
